Challenge2
The program first define the speed limit and the number of kilometers per demerit point. If the driver's speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, it outputs "Ok" and return from the function. Otherwise, it calculates the number of demerit points by subtracting the speed limit from the driver's speed and dividing by the kilometers per demerit point. We use the Math.floor function to round to the nearest integer. it checks if the driver has accumulated enough demerit points to have their license suspended. If so, it output "License suspended".
